# Artificial Intelligence Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The field of AI research was founded in 1956 and has since evolved into one of the most transformative technologies of our time.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

AI refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:
- Visual perception
- Speech recognition
- Decision-making
- Language translation
- Problem-solving
- Learning from experience

## History of AI

### Early Beginnings (1950s-1960s)
- 1950: Alan Turing proposes the "Turing Test"
- 1956: John McCarthy coins the term "Artificial Intelligence"
- 1957: First neural network machine built
- 1966: ELIZA, the first chatbot created

### AI Winter (1970s-1980s)
Reduced funding and interest due to:
- Limited computing power
- Unrealistic expectations
- Lack of theoretical understanding

### Revival (1990s-2000s)
- Increased computing power
- Better algorithms
- More data availability
- Practical applications emerge

### Modern Era (2010s-Present)

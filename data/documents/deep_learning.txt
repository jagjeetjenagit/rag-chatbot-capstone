# Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has revolutionized AI and powers many modern applications like image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning models are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. These models consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and transform data to learn complex patterns.

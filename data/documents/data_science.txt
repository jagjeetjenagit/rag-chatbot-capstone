```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.describe()  # Summary statistics
df.groupby('category').mean()  # Grouping
```

### Data Visualization
**Matplotlib**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('My Plot')
plt.show()
```

**Seaborn**
```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='salary', data=df)
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)
```

**Plotly**
```python
import plotly.express as px
fig = px.scatter(df, x='x', y='y', color='category')
fig.show()
```

### Machine Learning
**Scikit-learn**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
```
